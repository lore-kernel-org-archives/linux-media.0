I'm not either as it can only provide best-effort compatibility, but it
has proven to be useful. For instance, we successfully tested the
libcamera LD_PRELOAD v4l2-compat.so with Firefox before support for
PipeWire was ready in WebRTC, providing a way to use ISPs in video
conferencing as a stopgap measure. It's all about helping the ecosystem
with the transition, and not intended as a long-term solution.
