In addition to phones, there's also category of devices called IP
cameras, and managing them ubiquitos to other camera device is a
convenience to say the least.

And when it comes to pure testing, not all testing where V4L2 is
involved is neither about simulating V4L2 hardware nor centered around
V4L2 as a topic. It could be e.g., embedded system testing where you
want to mock the cameras with simulated content  in software only
testing (QEMU has V4L2 passthrough)
